## Project Proposal Abstract

Our  group  is interested in  analyzing  health  economics, primarily focusing on healthcare expenditure and its impact. We are currently looking at this through a global perspective but after our exploratory data analysis, we may choose to focus on a few specific countries for this project. Some of the aspects of health economics that we are currently thinking about including in our final project is: access to hospitals, access to medication/pharmacies, insurance costs and coverage and patient health outcomes for which we have identified relevant datasets.  

Our motivation for this project is to construct effective visualizations to  make the data clear to the general population for decision making processes. If they can see the impact of healthcare expenditure, they will be able to make informed decisions that may improve the situation overall.

Some potential visualizations we can use are: maps showing the difference in health expenditure impact around the world, scatter/line plots that will show the trends over time, and bar graphs to compare data  of different regions of differing economic development.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the health-economics
2. Using Microsoft Visual Studio Code, enter in the command line `Idyll`
3. Our post will appear at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Required Software

You must have Node.js installed. You can get it directly from https://nodejs.org/en/.
We highly suggest downloading Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

### Installation

- Clone and open your project repo on your own computer.
- Make sure you have `idyll` installed (`npm i -g idyll`).
- Run `npm install` to install project-specific dependencies.

npm is the node package manager. If you're curious how this works and what the project dependencies are, open up `package.json` to see where these are listed.

You can install custom dependencies by running `npm install <package-name> --save`. Note that any collaborators will also need to download the package locally by running `npm install` after pulling the changes.


#### Acknowledgements

This template was adapted from the initial Scrollytelling template for Idyll. The code and visualization examples were adapted from the [final project template](https://github.com/cse412-21w/project-demo) created for a previous offering of CSE 412.
