## Project Proposal Abstract

This is the space for you to add a description for your project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the health-economics
2. Using Microsoft Visual Studio Code, enter in the command line `Idyll`
3. Our post will appear at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Required Software

You must have Node.js installed. You can get it directly from https://nodejs.org/en/.
We highly suggest downloading Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

### Installation

- Clone and open your project repo on your own computer.
- Make sure you have `idyll` installed (`npm i -g idyll`).
- Run `npm install` to install project-specific dependencies.

npm is the node package manager. If you're curious how this works and what the project dependencies are, open up `package.json` to see where these are listed.

You can install custom dependencies by running `npm install <package-name> --save`. Note that any collaborators will also need to download the package locally by running `npm install` after pulling the changes.


#### Acknowledgements

This template was adapted from the initial Scrollytelling template for Idyll. The code and visualization examples were adapted from the [final project template](https://github.com/cse412-21w/project-demo) created for a previous offering of CSE 412.
