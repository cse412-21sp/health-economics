Intuitively, it may seem like higher rates of healthcare expenditure, particularly in the public sector, leads to better health outcomes, but it’s a bit more complicated than that. </p><p>This set of visualizations aims to identify the impact of health expenditure on health outcomes on the following three levels: as a percentage of total government expenditure, the costs of medicine, and hospital access. We will be focusing on the United States from a global perspective. </p><h2 id="global-context-of-health">Global Context of Health</h2><pre><code>“Developed countries tend to have higher percentages of GDP due to healthcare expenditure, with US having the highest percentage at 0.16% GDP”</code></pre><p>To get a global view of healthcare expenditure, it is useful to see the expenditure of each of the  global region as defined by the World Health Organization, which are defined as follows: </p><img src="./static/images/1a.png" alt="example"/><em>Image Source: <a href="https://www.who.int/about/regions/en/WHO_Regions.gif">World Health Organization</a></em></div><div class="fullWidth"><iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none" seamless="" src="https://plotly.com/~SahanaSundar/2/?showlink=false" height="800" width="100%"></iframe> </div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>Health expenditure fluctuated to varying degrees in each region between the years 1995 - 2014 but overall a larger proportion of government expenditure was dedicated to healthcare in 2014. The only exception to this trend is the Western Pacific region, but the decrease in expenditure was only 0.05% making the difference marginal.  The most significant increase was in the Americas region which changed from 14.87% in 1995 to 18.07%.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/FinalProjectGDPHealth/Sheet1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe><em>% of GDP due to healthcare expenditure is shown in this image. The darker the blue, the more percent of GDP due to healthcare. The scale is shown in the image as well. Used World Indicators Data.</em><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</a> is the market value of all goods and services produced in a country. The growth and innovation of all industries, including healthcare contribute to a country’s GDP. </p><p>As seen in the image above, more developed countries tend to have a greater percentage of GDP due to healthcare expenditure, with the US having the highest percentage. This makes sense, as more developed countries tend to have more advanced technologies and better facilities for treatment, which tend to be more expensive.</p><h2 id="impact-of-hospital-access">Impact of Hospital Access</h2><p>“The United States has the highest healthcare expenditure of $10966 per capita among all countries considered”</p><p>The first visualization is a representation of the overall healthcare expenditure across 12 countries - the United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden, United Kingdom, Japan, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland. </p><img src="./static/images/4.png" alt="example"/><p><br/> 
Looking at the healthcare expenditure per capita values for each of the countries above, it is clear that the United States has the highest healthcare expenditure from a global standpoint.  To understand the impact of healthcare expenditure, we can compare it with the cost of living for each of the countries being compared. The cost of living index is an indicator of how much goods and services cost. </p><img src="./static/images/5.png" alt="example"/><p><br/> 
From this visualization, it is clear that the US has the highest average healthcare expenditure per capita with an average cost of living index. To further analyze how this high expenditure influences the healthcare facilities available to people we can look at the hospital access vs cost of living in each of the states in the US where the number of hospital locations is a representation of the healthcare expenditure per capita. </p><h2 id="“within-the-us,-texas-has-the-most-extensive-hospital-access-and-a-below-average-cost-of-living-index-indicating-that-the-cost-of-living-and-healthcare-access-aren’t-correlated”">“Within the US, Texas has the most extensive hospital access and a below-average cost of living index indicating that the cost of living and healthcare access aren’t correlated”</h2><img src="./static/images/6.png" alt="example"/><p><br/> </p><h2 id="impact-of-health-costs-via-health-expenditure">Impact of Health Costs via Health Expenditure</h2><p>Universal Healthcare Coverage(UHC) is defined by the World Health Organization in which all citizens get 
access to basic healthcare without incurring financial hardship. UHC is most commonly executed in some 
countries as federally funded single payer healthcare systems, but can take other forms. A single payer 
healthcare system consists of a single entity for each country that is responsible for financing the 
health costs of all of their citizens and residents. </p><p>As the United States does not have universal healthcare in the form of a single payer system, our 
healthcare system can be extremely complicated and expensive to navigate. Consequently this leads to 
health inequities that aren’t seen at the same level in other developed countries with single payer 
health systems. In recent years the push for healthcare reform in the US (like the growing Medicare for 
All  movement) has made universal healthcare a prominent topic of discussion. </p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/map2_16225939646530/wholeworld?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe><p>Prior to creating this visualization we had assumed that since the United States didn’t have universal 
healthcare, it’s governmental expenditure on healthcare would be significantly lower than that of  
countries with universal healthcare. However, public expenditure for healthcare is similar to countries 
with healthcare systems that are globally seen as affordable and accessible such as the United Kingdom, 
Canada and many of the countries from the European Union. Also if we look at the countries with the 
highest healthcare expenditures from the government, we can see that they are from different regions, 
sizes and income groups.  </p><h3 id="medicine-costs">Medicine Costs</h3><p><img src="./static/images/8.png" alt="example"/>
Since many European countries and Canada have universal healthcare but have a similar percentage of 
spending on health expenditure as the United States, it brings the question whether the universal 
healthcare system in the European countries and Canada reduced the cost of medicine or drugs. 
According to an evaluation from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCDE), 
the United States has over three times the price of patented medicine compared to Canada and European 
countries for the year of 2019. This means despite having a similar percentage of on health expenditure, 
the price of medicine is drastically different. However, another differing factor is the actual amount 
being spent for each person in the population.</p><div></div><p>comparison of the individual European countries, Canada, and the United States. A trendline was made 
for individual European countries. Health expenditure per capita and medicine price ratio are from 2019.*</p><p>Despite the United States spending nearly twice as much as Canada on health expenditure per capita, 
the United States has three times the costs of medicine than Canada. However, looking at another lens 
can make sense of this trend. A possibility is that because the cost of medicine is high, then the 
country may have to invest more in health expenditure per capita. This can be seen in the positive 
trend occurring with the individual European countries where the higher the spending in health per 
capita, then the higher the drug price ratio. It was initially theorized that if a country doesn’t 
spend a low amount of money on health expenditure, then the country may not be able to help the 
population be able to afford medicine. Does the same theory apply to developing countries?</p></div><div class="fullWidth"><img src="./static/images/10.png" alt="example"/></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>For developing countries, the trend from developed countries seems to not apply. Instead of seeing a 
strong positive correlation between health expenditure and medicine price ratio, a lower variability is 
seen with higher health expenditure in both per capita and percentage in GDP. An interesting outlier is 
India which is 33.1 times higher than the international reference unit price of generic medicine. 
Meanwhile, Indonesia has a low median price ratio of 1.8 despite having similar health expenditure as 
India. The reasoning is outside just the numbers on health expenditure and more in depth of governmental 
policies and perhaps medicine availability in that country. For instance, it wasn’t until 2014 India 
started focusing on creating policies to help control drug prices. The data represented here was an 
average pricing from 2007 to 2013.</p><p>In regards to pricing of medicine, the United States government currently does not conduct direct 
regulation or negotiation of drug prices. This could explain the high cost of medicine even with such 
a high health expenditure budget.</p></div><div class="fullWidth"><img src="./static/images/11.png" alt="example"/></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>In the United States, wholesale acquisition costs (estimate of the manufacturer’s list price for a drug to
wholesalers or direct purchasers) of drugs that have been increasing in price have a consistent price 
change. Every year since 2016, the costs of those drugs have increased at least 7% more than the 
prior year. Other countries were shown to observe any possible impacts of imported drugs from the US 
to countries like India, Canada, or the European Union. For the United States, Canada, and the European 
Union, they show about 1% to 3% increase in health expenditure than its prior year from 2016-2019. India 
has the highest increase in health expenditure but it also is showing less of increase from the year 2016 to 2019. </p><p>For comparing the changes in health expenditure of the US and the changes in increasing drug prices, 
it seems not to have a significant impact as it does not follow the trend of changes in drug price. 
The rationale is the drugs that have been increasing in price are most likely drugs not commonly 
purchased by the public. This same rationale might apply or they have their own generic brand for 
countries like Canada or the European Union that have their own regulation in pricing of medicine 
to be affordable. Overall, health expenditure in the US is high partly from the contribution of 
unregulated and higher priced medicine.</p></div></div></div></div>
