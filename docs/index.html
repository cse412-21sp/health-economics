      <h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1><p>This article analyzes health  economics, primarily focusing on healthcare expenditure and its impact. 
      This was analyzed through a global perspective. Some of the aspects of health economics included are:  global analysis of health expenditures, 
      current global status on emphasis on health, costs of medicine, and hospital access.</p>
      <p>Our motivation for this project is to inform the general population for future decision making processes regarding health. 
      If they can see the impact of healthcare expenditure, the general population will be able to make informed 
      decisions that may improve the situation overall.</p>

      <p>As the health of their citizens is a priority for many countries, it’s natural that it would be part of each country’s total government expenditure. 
      Prior to creating these visualizations we thought that countries that are commonly known to have universal healthcare such as Canada and 
      much of the European Union would have much higher spending on healthcare than countries such as the United States. </p>
